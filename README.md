## üß† AI Flows

This project leverages Genkit to define several AI-powered flows:

- **`generateConversationalResponse`**: Handles general user queries and maintains a conversational context.
- **`answerFromDocument`**: Takes a document and a query, then analyzes the document's content to formulate an answer.
- **`translateText`**: Translates the AI-generated responses into the user's selected language, enabling the multi-language feature.
- **`retrieveRelevantFAQs`**: A flow designed to pull relevant FAQs based on user input (can be extended for FAQ features).
